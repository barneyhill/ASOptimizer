# ASOptimizer

11/06/2024 - Our paper "ASOptimizer: Optimizing antisense oligonucleotides through deep learning for IDO1 gene regulation" has been published at *Molecular Therapy Nucleic Acids*.

06/12/2024 - The code for chemical engineering and the corresponding experimental data are publicly available for reference and use.

To access ASOptimizer, we have developed a web server that runs ASOptimizer on the backend and provided free access to it. You can access it through the following link: http://asoptimizer.s-core.ai/

> **ASOptimizer consists of a database and two computational models: *sequence engineering* and *chemical engineering***.

> **This repository focuses exclusively on the *chemical engineering* , providing related data and source code**.

## 📂 Key Components

- **Chemical Engineering**  
  Algorithms and data pipelines for molecular structure analysis and optimization.

- **Dataset**  
  Includes experimentally validated chemical data and simulation results.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from the following:

1. [Dataset from *Spidercore Inc.*] ([URL](https://github.com/Spidercores/ASOptimizer/tree/main/dataset) to dataset)  
   - Description: A curated dataset of in vitro experimental results, primarily gathered from published data samples on Lens.org through an iterative data collection process.
   - Source: Spidercore Inc. Special thanks to our dedicated team members for their efforts in compiling and organizing this dataset.  

2. [Dataset source from *Roche.*] ([URL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253119304068))  
   - Description: This dataset contains 256 experimental results of ASO experiments trageting HIF1A gene discussed in the following publication:
   - Source: Papargyri, N., Pontoppidan, M., Andersen, M.R., Koch, T., and Hagedorn, P.H.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spidercores/ASOptimizer.git
cd ASOptimizer
mkdir data
```

###  Install Dependencies
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 and tensorflow 2.3.0.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data preprocessing
- data_type: 'training'

  Creates a paired dataset (graph representation) for chemical engineering tasks (D_train, D_test).

- data_type: 'screening'
  
  Generates a dataset (graph representation) from experimental data provided by Roche.
  
```bash
python3 libpreprocess/make_tfrecords.py --data_type 'training'
python3 libpreprocess/make_tfrecords.py --data_type 'screening'
```

### Run Training and Evaluations

- mode: 'train'

Train ASOptimizer using Dtrain.

- mode: 'test'

Test ASOptimizer using Dtest.

- mode: 'screen'

Evaluate and generate scores for the desired ASO using Dscreen. The data used for screening is currently set to Roche's dataset, stored in the screening folder.

```bash
python3 main.py --mode 'train'
python3 main.py --mode 'test'
python3 main.py --mode 'screen'
```

### Checkpoints
We provide a pre-trained model checkpoint on our paper. These checkpoint can be used to evaluate directly for inference.  

1. **Model Checkpoint (`checkpoints/training_checkpoints`)**  
```bash
  checkpoint_dir = './checkpoints/training_checkpoints'
  with mirrored_strategy.scope():
      model = self.EGT_Backbone(node_dim, edge_dim, model_height, num_head, num_vnode,max_length)
      model.summary()
      model.load_weights(os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'best_checkpoint'))
```

### Model architecture

The model architecture used in this project is based on the implementation from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/shamim-hussain/egt). The code has been adapted and extended to suit the specific requirements of our project.
We express our gratitude to the original authors for their valuable contributions to the open-source community.
